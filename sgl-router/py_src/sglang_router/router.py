class Router:
    """
    A high-performance router for distributing requests across worker nodes.

    Args:
        worker_urls: List of URLs for worker nodes that will handle requests. Each URL should include
            the protocol, host, and port (e.g., ['http://worker1:8000', 'http://worker2:8000'])
        policy: Load balancing policy to use. Options:
            - PolicyType.Random: Randomly select workers
            - PolicyType.RoundRobin: Distribute requests in round-robin fashion
            - PolicyType.CacheAware: Distribute requests based on cache state and load balance
        host: Host address to bind the router server. Default: '127.0.0.1'
        port: Port number to bind the router server. Default: 3001
        cache_threshold: Cache threshold (0.0-1.0) for cache-aware routing. Routes to cached worker
            if the match rate exceeds threshold, otherwise routes to the worker with the smallest
            tree. Default: 0.5
        balance_abs_threshold: Load balancing is triggered when (max_load - min_load) > abs_threshold
            AND max_load > min_load * rel_threshold. Otherwise, use cache aware. Default: 32
        balance_rel_threshold: Load balancing is triggered when (max_load - min_load) > abs_threshold
            AND max_load > min_load * rel_threshold. Otherwise, use cache aware. Default: 1.0001
        eviction_interval_secs: Interval in seconds between cache eviction operations in cache-aware
            routing. Default: 60
        max_payload_size: Maximum payload size in bytes. Default: 4MB
        max_tree_size: Maximum size of the approximation tree for cache-aware routing. Default: 2^24
        verbose: Enable verbose logging. Default: False
